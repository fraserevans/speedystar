    "By default, `speedystar` ejects stars from the Galactic Centre. The ejection methods in `speedystar.eject` can take a `galpy` orbit object as an argument to eject stars from a moving object (e.g. the LMC, M31, globular clusters), though the moving object must be set up in a particular way to ensure stars are ejected from the correct location at the correct time. Here we will use the LMC as an example."
