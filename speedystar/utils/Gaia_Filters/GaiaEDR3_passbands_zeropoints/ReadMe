Abstract:
Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR3) contains astrometry and photometry results for about
1.8 billion sources based on observations collected by the European Space Agency Gaia
satellite during the first 34 months of its operational phase. In this paper, we focus
on the photometric content, describing the input data, the algorithms, the processing
and the validation of the results. Particular attention is given to the quality of the
data and to a number of features that users may need to take into account to make the
best use of the EDR3 catalogue. The processing broadly followed the same procedure as
for DR2, but with significant improvements in several aspects of the BP/RP preprocessing
and in the photometric calibration process. In particular the treatment of BP/RP background
has been updated to include a better estimation of the local background and the detection
of crowding effects has been used to exclude affected data from the calibrations. The
photometric calibration models have also been updated to account for flux loss over the
whole magnitude range. Significant improvements in the modelling and calibration of the
Gaia point and line spread functions, as presented in Rowell et al. (2020), have also
helped reducing a number of instrumental effects that were still present in DR2. EDR3
contains 1,806 million sources with G photometry and 1,540 million sources with G_BP and
G_RP photometry. The median uncertainty in the G photometry, as measured from the 
standard deviation of the internally calibrated mean photometry for a given source,
is 0.2 mmag at magnitude G=10 to 14, 0.8 mmag at G~17 and 2.6 mmag at G~19. The significant
magnitude term found in the DR2 photometry is no longer visible and overall there are no 
trends larger than 1 mmag/mag. Using one passband over the whole colour and magnitude range
leaves no systematics above the 1% level in magnitude in all bands, a larger systematic is
present for a very small sample of bright and blue sources. A detailed description of the 
residual systematic effects is provided. Overall the quality of the calibrated mean 
photometry in EDR3 is superior with respect to DR2, for all bands.

Description:
These tabular data describes the photometric system defined by the G, G_BP 
and G_RP Gaia bands for Gaia Early Data Release 3.
The tables provide the full passband and the corresponding zero point
for each of the photometric bands. The zero points are available both in
the VEGAMAG and AB systems.
The passband calibration is based on the modelling of a set of corrections 
applied to pre-launch knowledge of the instrument, to find the best match 
between observed and synthetic photometry for a set of calibrators. For EDR3 a large set
of calibrators covering a wide range of spectra types was used for the passband calibration.
For these sources reconstructed SEDs were obtained from externally calibrated Gaia BP/RP 
spectra.
